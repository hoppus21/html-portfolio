<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm <strong>Marek Záhorec</strong>, a web developer based in Vienna, Austria. Originally from the charming town of Trnava, Slovakia, my journey has been anything but conventional. After spending 15 years as a dedicated physiotherapist, I decided to follow my passion for technology and creativity by venturing into the world of coding. This bold career change has allowed me to channel my problem-solving skills and dedication into building dynamic, user-friendly web experiences.

  My portfolio showcases a variety of web development projects, demonstrating my versatility and enthusiasm for crafting intuitive digital solutions. From sleek, responsive websites to complex web applications, I'm driven by a love for turning ideas into reality.

  Beyond coding, I express my creativity in other ways. I’m the proud founder of a rock music project called <strong>Chapter 13</strong>, where I compose and produce original music. In addition to my musical pursuits, I also enjoy writing fiction, creating stories that reflect my imagination and love for storytelling.
